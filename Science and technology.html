    <div class="p1"><p>Ever since Independence Modern India has had a strong focus on science and technology, realising that it is a key element for economic and social growth.</p></div>
<br>
<div class="p2"><p><li>Mangalyaan – India’s first aircraft to Mars entered Mar’s Orbit on September 24, 2014, making India the first Asian country and only the fourth country in the world to enter the Mars orbit in its first attempt.</li><br>
    <li>India successfully launched Chandrayaan in 2008 in order to explore the moon. The craft was inserted into lunar orbit in its first attempt. One of the greatest achievement of Chadrayaan was the discovery of the water molecules in the lunar soil.</li><br>
    <li>Indian company Hero MotoCorp is the world’s largest manufacturer of two-wheelers.</li><br>
    <li>S.Chandrashekhar is widely known for his extraordinary work in the radiation of energy from stars, particularly white dwarf stars or dying fragments of stars. Interestingly, the Chandrashekar Limit is named after him. He is regarded as one of the pioneers in applied mathematics in astrophysics.</li><br>
    <li>C.V.Raman is the first Asian to be decorated with the Nobel Peace Prize. He further also worked on the acoustics of musical instruments and investigated the harmonic nature of instruments such as a tabla and a mridangam. He also pioneered changes in wavelength when light reflects a transparent material. This is now known as the Raman Scattering and the phenomena are referred to as the Raman Effect.</li><br>
    <li>The Indian National Satellite System or the INSAT is India’s very own domestic communication satellite. It has two multipurpose satellites in geostationary orbit, each of which has twelve 36 MHz-wide C-band channels, two 36 MHz-wide S-band channels and a Very High Resolution. India is one of the only few countries to have such a satellite. It is an extraordinaire achievement and puts us on the spot with some very developed nations.</li><br>
    <li>It is quite an interesting fact to know that India is one of the greatest hubs for Information Technology services. A report showed that out of the top 20 best Information Technology companies in the world, 5 companies are Indian companies. These companies include TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and HCL technologies. Apart from these five companies, we also are aware of India’s tremendous contribution to Silicon Valley. Indian Tech companies have driven growth, increased access to resources, healthcare, and education, creating jobs, resulting in falling poverty levels, and advanced lifestyles.</li><br>
    <li>India is at the forefront of technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and 2019 has been regarded as quite the year for the Indian start-up ecosystem. The nation is home to some of the youngest entrepreneurs in the world, with the average age of founders at a mere 27 years. The strong ecosystem has seen a rising number of successful start-ups being churned out and exits taking place, indicating signs of a maturing ecosystem. This has definitely led to an increase in superior quality entrepreneurs, investors, and mentors with past experience helping develop and accelerate new businesses.</li><br>
    <li>India’s INSAT system is one of the largest domestic communication satellites that are owned by any nation in the Asia-Pacific region. It initiated a major revolution in India’s communications sector. This puts us on a list of a few who possess an indigenous communication satellite for domestic use in the Asia-Pacific region.</li>
