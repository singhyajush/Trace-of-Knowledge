    <p>Greatest Achievements of India in Sports: Sports have a long history in India, dating back to the Vedic era. Religious liberties fueled physical culture in ancient India. “Duty is in my right hand, and the benefits of triumph are in my left,” reads the Atharvaveda mantra. These phrases, in terms of an ideal, are similar to the classic Olympic Oath: “For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport.”<br>In the history of Indian sports growth, India has accomplished significant landmarks in those moments when we came together as a country, stood together, and restored faith in ourselves. Let’s recall the greatest sports achievements of India in sports & know the athletes who made it possible.
